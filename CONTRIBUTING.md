Contributing
------------
Thank you in advance!

### Requirements
* JDK 8+
* Gradle 2.4+

### Process
1. Create an issue and discuss with project owners. Make sure this is work we see as being a valuable contribution before you do anything else! We'd hate for you to spend a lot of time and mental energy only to have us say "*Ehhmm, we don't want that - so sorry.*" (!)
2. Fork us on GitHub.
3. Make your changes, feel free to post any questions/concerns to the issue and we'll get them answered.
4. Test, test, test! While we feel 100% code coverage is a little extreme, test classes that check "happy path" and at least the majority of the "not-so-happy path" flows are a must.
5. Before you push any changes, make sure you can run `gradle build` from your command-line and that all tests/analyses pass.
6. Push to your branch.
7. Create a GitHub pull request and we'll take a look.
8. Once approved and merged we'll run a gamut of smoke tests and then (likely) we'll release almost immediately.

Thanks!
